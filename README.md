# FreeCell for Linux
**NOTE:**

This program is derived from FreeCell for DOS v 1.1 by me. It was for Turbo C++ v 3.0, and used custom libraries. Most of such code is removed and aim of this program is to just be compatible with g++. The original program was not throughly checked for bugs.

Attribution is not mandatory but if you find this program helpful to you in anyway, dropping me an email will greatly satisfy my narcissistic needs and thus make me happy. :)

## TODO:

1. ~~Add fancyful colours.~~
1. Undo implemntation is still pending, but it should be straight forward to implement it via command pattern.
1. Add GUI support, preferably android.
1. Improve curses input support to show intended card.
1. Add unicode characters.
